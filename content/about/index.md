A lot of information in graduate school is shared through informal channels, like coffee chats, happy hours, and random office encounters. The goal of this blog is to try and provide a compilation of advice in a more formal setting so that everyone can have easier access to it. 

## Who are we? 

We are three PhD students who met during our remote summer internship during the summer of 2020. 

### [Melody Huang](https://melodyyhuang.github.io/)

Melody is a third year Ph.D. student at UCLA studying Statistics. Her primary research interests are in causal inference and social statistics. Besides research, she likes leaving her apartment to go outside, scrolling through Twitter, and watching the Bachelor. 

### [Mikaela Meyer](https://mikaelameyer.netlify.app)

Mikaela is a third year Ph.D. student in the joint Statistics and Public Policy Ph.D. program at Carnegie Mellon University. Her research thus far has focused on applying statistics to criminal justice problems, such as racial disparities in police use-of-force, and statistics pedagogy. In her spare time, Mikaela enjoys playing every team intramural sport at CMU (in non-pandemic times), playing board games, and riding her bike.
