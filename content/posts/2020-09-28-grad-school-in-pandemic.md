A lot of this advice is generalizable to graduate school advice, even outside the context of trying to do a Ph.D. in the middle of a pandemic. I’ve found that things that used to be helpful in (1) maintaining my mental health, and (2) being able to be productive have now become crucial to hitting a baseline level of sanity and getting literally anything done.

There are a couple caveats that should be highlighted: (1) I have been lucky in the sense that my Ph.D. requires no wet lab work, or work that necessitates my physical presence in any actual location. As a result, from a pragmatic standpoint, social distancing and working from home has really been an inconvenience, but not detrimental to my ability to make progress. (2) I have no family to take care of; for the most part, it’s sufficient for me to focus on my own health and well-being since I’m not directly responsible for taking care of someone else.

# Practical Advice for Research 
## Point 1. Make a plan for the term. 
There is nothing more existential crisis inducing than waking up and not knowing what you’re supposed to be doing that day. Try to think about what you want to accomplish over the course of the quarter (or even better, talk to your advisor about what you guys want to get done). Think about how to break that down week-by-week, day-by-day. Research is daunting because you often will deal with project timelines that span months, if not years, before the project is “complete”. It can be helpful to break down these large-scale projects into small, doable chunks. This can help remind you concretely of the progress you’re making towards a bigger picture goal. 

On a micro-level, I’ve been more successful on days where I define a to-do list for that day with actionable items (i.e., “review someone’s code” versus “work on x project”). Looking at my to-do list for the whole week can be really daunting, but seeing that I was able to finish almost all or all of the things I set out to do that day feels really good. In that vein, it is better to evaluate yourself on the basis of goals met, rather than time spent. We can also mention the “reward yourself” thing we talked about last week, too.

## Point 2. Minimum Viable Product. 
Tech companies have a concept known as “Minimum Viable Product”, which describes the bare minimum amount of features a product must have working in order to ship out to customers. The idea is that after shipping out the MVP, companies can gather feedback to iterate. 

At first glance, MVP seems counter-intuitive in the context of graduate school. Academic culture ostensibly rewards the pursuit of obsessive perfectionism. The story of Andrew Wiles spending 6 years in total secrecy trying to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem is often told as a canonical research story.\footnote{It should be noted that even Wiles, at the end of his 6 years in isolation/secrecy, reached out to other researchers.} However, while some academics may enjoy sitting in isolation for 8 year working on a single proof, research does not necessarily have to occur in a vacuum. 

While graduate school tends to focus more on individual work, learn to break down your research project into small chunks, and identify where the minimum viable product is in each chunk. Learn to ship it as quickly as possible to get feedback. Reach out to people—collaborators, people in your lab, your advisor, fellow classmates, or committee members—to review your work in an iterative process. As a graduate student, your goal is to learn how to become an effective researcher. It’s easy to be caught up in all the components of your project that are not done or perfect and spend days trying to synthesize a perfect solution. In reality, what you should be doing is producing a minimum viable product and iterating towards the final solution slowly. 

## Point 3. Virtual accountability partners. 
Accountability partners can be a great way to keep yourself organized and focused. At its core, accountability partners try to keep each other accountable. Given the nebulous nature of graduate school, it can be helpful to have an external person (who is not your advisor) keep you on track for things you need to get done. Try to set up check-in times with your accountability partner. These check-ins don’t have to be super intensive--they can be as easy as a simple text! This can also help incentivize you to sit down each week and think of concrete things you need to get done. 
 
## Point 4. Time blocking. 
Prior to the pandemic, I feel like I already had a lot of meetings. Now, I spend lots of time on Zoom calls for various projects, classes, etc. To make sure that I have uninterrupted time during at least some days to focus on my work, I have purposely blocked off times on my calendar where I refuse to take meetings. These are somewhat based on when I’m most productive during the week; I usually start off strong and focused, so I have fewer meetings on Monday and Tuesday than I do on Wednesday and Thursday. 
 
It can be helpful to set aside days where you can dedicate yourself solely to working on research. Alternatively, block off time during the day that you know you are most productive. Terrence Tao calls this [task batching](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together/), in which he describes batching tasks that require similar mental loads together. For example, if you are a morning person, batch your high mental load tasks in the morning, and leave your low mental load tasks (i.e., replying to emails) for the afternoon. 

A lot of time blocking comes down to knowing what works for you, and what you consider high, medium, and low mental load tasks. It also will depend on the flexibility of your schedule. However, even with external constraints, learning to batch tasks within whatever constraints in your schedule can help save your mental energy for tasks that require it, and churn through draining items on your to-do list. 

# Advice for mental health 
Social interactions during the pandemic require a lot more forethought and intentionality. You can no longer rely on running into someone in the office to hit your social interaction quota for the day. If you’re a dedicated introvert, you might be discovering a limiting bound on the amount of introversion you have. If you’re an extrovert, not having the opportunity to engage with other human beings and encounter random interactions can be difficult to deal with. 

## Point 1. Schedule those Zoom calls with your friends
Geographical constraints have never been more irrelevant. Reconnect with your friends who might be sprawled across different cities and states. Binge watch a Netflix show together. A perk of this I realized this week is that I used to spend most days pre-pandemic talking to only statistics PhD students, which meant we inevitably spent a chunk of time talking about work, and I was talking to a bunch of people who were doing very similar things to me. It was easy to forget about the real world’s existence. Now, I have Zoom calls with friends from undergrad and high school throughout the week, so I feel like it’s been easier to stay grounded than it usually is.

## Point 2. Exercise. 
I am generally a big fan of being sedentary. However, there is well-documented research that exercise is good for you. If you’re feeling extra ambitious, you can also do an exercise video on YouTube while Zooming with a friend who is also doing the same exercise video. 

I usually like to go for a run or walk every day to see the outside world and kill two birds with one stone (see Point 2.5), but if you live on the West Coast, where things have quite literally become a dumpster fire, here are some alternative home workouts you could do:

### Point 2.5. Go outside! 
I usually try to at least go for a walk every day in an attempt to remember there is more to the world than my room and the kitchen in my apartment. 

## Point 3. Treat your research like a job. 
It is easy, especially when working from home, to forget that work life boundaries exist. Try setting aside concrete times for you to dedicate to working on your research. For example, if you’re a fan of the 8 am - 5 pm work life, block off those times to work, and set a hard stop at the end of the day. Try to avoid distractions (like Netflix) during these dedicated work times. It can be helpful to schedule virtual catch-ups with friends at the end of the work day to induce artificial pressure to finish work for the day before 5 pm. 

## Point 4. Try to re-create some of the interactions you would have had during the day.
In normal times, I usually ate lunch (and often dinner) in the office with friends, went to the gym in the middle of the day, and had random conversations with friends in the common areas for periodic breaks. While it’s hard to re-create some of these interactions, I’ve shared a Zoom link with friends around the time I’m eating lunch in case they want to join me and chat briefly. People taking classes in my department have set up Zoom rooms where people can pop in and out as desired to chat through homework sets. I’ve also tried to set up more random phone or Zoom calls in the middle of the day. Striving to have similar levels of interaction, even if it’s virtual, can help create a semblance of normalcy. Pro-tip: you could try scheduling these moments in between time blocks and force yourself to take a break. 

# Conclusion 
While the title of the post promotes tips for productivity during the pandemic, I think it is important to point out that maximizing productivitiy may not necessarily be what we should all be prioritizing right now. In times when the temptation to doom scroll and obsessively think about societal collapse is stronger than ever, it can be helpful to remind ourselves that research is incremental, and so is personal progress. Trying to maintain net positive days (i.e., being able to cross off at least 1 item on your to-do list, whether it be research or personal related) is a success.
